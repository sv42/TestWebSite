  <h1 align="center">Hello, Mercury!</h1>

  <div class="info">
    <p>Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System.
      In English, it is named after the ancient Roman god Mercurius, god of commerce and communication, and the
      messenger
      of the gods.
      Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars.</p>
    <p>Mercury's sidereal year (88.0 Earth days) and sidereal day (58.65 Earth days) are in a 3:2 ratio.
      This
      relationship is called spinâ€“orbit resonance, and sidereal here means "relative to the stars". Consequently, one
      solar day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts for around 176 Earth days: twice the planet's sidereal year. This
      means that one side of Mercury will remain in sunlight for one Mercurian year of 88 Earth days; while during the
      next orbit, that side will be in darkness all the time until the next sunrise after another 88 Earth days.</p>
