  <h1 align="center">Hello, Jupiter!</h1>

  <div class="info">
    <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. A gas giant, Jupiter's mass is more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86 years. It is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus and has been observed since prehistoric times. Its name derives from Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.</p>
    <p>Jupiter was the first planet to form, and its inward migration during the primordial Solar System impacted much of the formation history of the other planets. Hydrogen constitutes 90% of Jupiter's volume, followed by helium, which forms 25% of its mass and 10% of its volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives from the Sun. Its internal structure is believed to consist of an outer mantle of fluid metallic hydrogen and a diffuse inner core of denser material. Because of its rapid rotation rate of one rotation per ten hours, Jupiter's shape is an oblate spheroid; it possesses a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. The most obvious result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been recorded since at least 1831.</p>
